This program should be run on MacOS with make -f Makefile.mac run
To open another SMF file run e.g. ./assignment6 bound-bunny_200.smf

A demo video showing keyboard (tested on a linux system) is at: https://youtu.be/Y0RB2aLCO_U

Known issues (leftover from A5): 

Can't visualize/normalize points for unbound/large models like lo-sphere.smf, cylinder.smf, however tested with all SMFs in project folder.

Press: w - To decrease light height
Press: 3 - To increase orbit radius
Press: 4 - To decrease orbit radius
Press: e - To increase light radius
Press: r - To decrease light radius
Press: 5 - To increase camera angle (rotate camera)
Press: 6 - To decrease camera angle (rotate counterclockwise)
Press: t - To increase light angle (rotate camera)
Press: y - To decrease light angle (rotate counterclockwise)

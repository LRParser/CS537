This program should be run on MacOS with make -f Makefile.mac run
To open another SMF file run e.g. ./assignment5 octahedron.smf
One window opens,named "Assignment 5".
The SMF model is shown allowing the following usage:

Press: 1 - To increase camera height
Press: 2 - To decrease camera height
Press: 3 - To increase orbit radius
Press: 4 - To decrease orbit radius
Press: 5 - To increase cylinder angle
Press: 6 - To decrease cylinder angle
Press: 7 - To switch to perspective projection mode (default)
Press: 8 - To switch to parallel projection mode
Press: q - To exit the program

Note that as discussed in class, changing the orbit radius in parallel mode will show a front or back clipping plane based on whether radius is increased or decreased

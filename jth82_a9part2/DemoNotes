Program implements only

Demo:
Zoom in by pressing 4 to decrease camera radius
Decrease light radius by pressing e, then move back pressing r
Rotate light around object pressing t and y. Note specular moves
Change to dark blue low specular material 2, pressing s
Change to dark green medium specular material 3, pressing d
Increase/decrease light height by pressing q and w
Press x to exit
Load another model on command line (octahedron.smf)
Hit 'g' and 'p' to toggle between Gouraud and Phong shading

Known issues (leftover from A5): 

Can't visualize/normalize points for unbound/large models like lo-sphere.smf, cylinder.smf, however tested with all SMFs in project folder.

Note - program only implements a single independently rotating light.
